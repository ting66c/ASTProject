The repository for 2775J's VRC Change Up code.

The primary code for the robot is under the "src" folder, with file names ending in ".cpp". This is where autonomous and usercontrol are coded, and furthermore, individual functions can be found in files such as "rollers.cpp". The corresponding header files are located under the "include" folder, with file names ending in ".h".

Our programming skills is located in the "src" folder, in auton.cpp. The program we used for our 64 point programming skills run is located near the bottom of auton.cpp and is called "diagonalSkills".
